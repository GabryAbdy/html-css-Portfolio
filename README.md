This is my first project, a personal portfolio.

Everything is organized into folders.
The "index.html" file in the root is the homepage, while the other "index.html" files inside the "projects" and "contacts"
represent the other pages (I used this method in order to have a cleaner URL).

The "assets" folder contain three sub-folders:
- "css" with the "style.css" file (and the map);
- "scss" with the "style.scss" file;
- "img" with all the images used in the project;
- "js" in this case is empty because I didn't create any Javascript file (I used the script tags in the html files, since it wasn't the scope of the project at the moment).

I used Bootstrap as a framework, Fontawesome for some icons and EmailJS for the contact form.

I will update this project as soon as I will achive more skills.
